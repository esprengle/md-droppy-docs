## Workspace directory

Here you can change the directory that contains your *Images*, *Tasks* and *Workflows*.

The default is `/Users/YourUserName/DropPy`, but it can be placed anywhere.

The required sub-directories will be created automatically.

## Default Workspace content

This button allows to restore the bundled *Images*, *Tasks* and *Workflows* into your DropPy *Workspace* directory.

*Images*, *Tasks* and *Workflows* that you **added yourself will not be overwritten**.

If you **changed a bundled file** however, **it will be overwritten**!

## Bundled version

The release number of the bundled default *Workspace* content.

At any point in time <a href="https://github.com/geberl/droppy-workspace" target="_blank">GitHub repository {{%icon fa-external-link-square%}}</a> might contain slightly later files. If there is a **new release** of the *Workspace* a **new release** of *DropPy* is pushed as well so you'll get notified through the [automatical update check]({{< ref "general.md#update-check" >}}).

## Open source

DropPy's default *Workspace* content is open source. This button opens the <a href="https://github.com/geberl/droppy-workspace" target="_blank">GitHub repository {{%icon fa-external-link-square%}}</a> in your browser.
