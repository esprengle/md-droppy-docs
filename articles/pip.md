# pip

**pip** is the PyPA recommended tool for installing Python packages. Any package that is not part of Python's standard library can easily be installed using this tool.

Unfortunatly `pip` doesn't come with the pre-installed version of Python on macOS.

## Errors

If `pip` is not installed and you are trying to run it your *Terminal* will show an error:

```bash
> -bash: pip: command not found
```

## Installation

```bash
sudo easy_install pip
```
